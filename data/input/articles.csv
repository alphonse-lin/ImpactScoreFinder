Disasters on the transportation network, whether attributable to nature, human error, or human intent, raise awareness of the need for plans of action to quickly restore mobility. Resilience of the transportation network is the capacity to absorb the effects of a disruption and to quickly return to normal operating levels. Resilience measures are useful to evaluate and predict disruptions and recovery and to guide infrastructure investments that protect against those disruptions or that accelerate recovery after a disruption. This paper presents a methodology for estimating two composite resilience measures-reduction and recovery. The method is illustrated by using resilience triangles derived from sampled truck speeds and counts along the Interstate 90/94 corridor from Hudson to Beloit, Wisconsin during two significant weather events in 2008. This paper presents a set of criteria, on the basis of observed effects on various sections of the highway corridor, to qualify the computed resilience measures. In this paper, the focus is on generalizing the characteristics of the resilience response rather than characteristics of the corridor sections that lead to patterns of the response for each section. The criteria and the measures together are a useful tool to evaluate resilience. DOI: 10.1061/(ASCE)TE.1943-5436.0000415.

However, they must also maintain an acceptable level of service to critical infrastructures in the case of disruptions, especially during natural disasters. We have developed a method for assessing the resilience of transportation network topology when exposed to environmental hazards. This approach integrates graph theory with stress testing methodology and involves five basic steps: (1) establishment of a scenario set that covers a range of seismic damage potential in the network, (2) assessment of resilience using various graph-based metrics, (3) topology-based simulations, (4) evaluation of changes in graph-based metrics, and (5) examination of resilience in terms of spatial distribution of critical nodes and the entire network topology. Our case study was from the city of Kathmandu in Nepal, where the earthquake on April 25, 2015, followed by a major aftershock on May 12, 2015, led to numerous casualties and caused significant damage. Therefore, it is a good example for demonstrating and validating the developed methodology. The results presented here indicate that the proposed approach is quite efficient and accurate in assisting stakeholders when evaluating the resilience of transportation networks based on their topology. © Springer Science+Business Media B.V.","<p>Export Date: 19 November 2022</p>

This study proposes a new predictive method to implement, in an operational way, the concept of resilience by exploring the robustness of the road network in Baalbek-Hermel Governorate (Lebanon) in order to predict its future behavior in response to natural hazards occurrence. The proposed methodology consists of a predictive-spatial-analytic approach based on geospatial numerical models combined with an R-NetSwan function for modeling and simulating critical infrastructures. The results show that Baalbek-Hermel’s road network is moderately resilient since it reaches a total loss of connectivity when nearly 60% of its critical nodes are blocked or damaged. Earthquakes proved to be the most disruptive hazards of this network, threatening the connectivity, starting its first damaged nodes, and causing the highest percentages of connectivity loss (70%). The novelty of this method lies in utilizing network analysis to reveal roads resilience to different natural hazards and serve several operational targets: revealing the defects of the road network for improvement or the construction of new detours, as well as allowing the first aid services to better visualize these weaknesses and to better prepare themselves.

Transportation systems are also influenced by climate change directly and indirectly and on a variety of spatial and temporal scales. Under a changing climate, many regions around the globe and especially in urban areas, have experienced increases in flood intensity and frequency in recent decades. Flooding can strain transportation networks in both the short- and long-term through transportation delays, infrastructure damage, and recovery, and potentially affect economies. The present article is a review of how flooding impacts transportation networks in both short- and long-term timescales and their subsequent impact on resiliency of the network. Firstly, flood effects are classified based on the connections between the type of flooding and the type of impact (either direct or indirect) on the transportation system. An analysis of the assessment methods and the transport models used to formulate flood effects on the transportation system is provided, as well as the drawbacks from the context of timescales, and recommendations for future research. The analysis indicates that the majority of the articles assess the direct and tangible impacts with focus on the resilience of the transportation network in short- and medium-term temporal scales and at smaller spatial scales. There is less emphasis on indirect, intangible flood impacts, and long-term temporal scales.

Flooding scenarios in 2045 are developed based on different adaptation standards under the 100-year storm surge and population projections are from the land-use conflict identification strategy (LUCIS) model. Our analysis indicates that about 29.3% of the transportation infrastructure, including areas of the US No. 1 highway, roadways in the south and southwest of the county, and bridges connecting Miami Beach area, will be damaged under the storm surge when a low-level adaptation standard is chosen. However, the high-level adaptation standard will reduce the vulnerable infrastructures to 12.4%. Furthermore, the total increased travel time of the low-level adaptation standard could be as high as twice of that in the high-level adaptation standard during peak morning hours.

Therefore, scholars, scientists, and urban planners must study and discuss disasters, so as to work toward important concepts such as resilient cities, resilient landscapes, and disaster prevention parks. This study discusses the resilience park from the perspective of the resilient city. Since the harm caused by natural disasters to parks is mainly due to flooding and high winds, this study focuses on the prevention and control of flood and wind damage. This study is an attempt to explore the indicators of resilience of parks in the context of flood and wind damage, calculate the indicator weight of resilience parks, and establish an indicator evaluation system for resilience parks. The research methods of this study are the Fuzzy Delphi method and the network analysis program method. The results show that the indicators of a resilience park under flood disaster are different types of soil drainage capacity grade (0.199), the lawn to permeable ratio (0.248), the permeable pavement grade (0.125), and the degradation basin grade (0.177).

Model 1 consists of two spatio-temporal blocks considering the adjacency and distance between road segments, while model 2 contains an additional elevation block to account for elevation difference between road segments. Model 3 includes three blocks for considering the adjacency and the product of distance and elevation difference between road seg-ments. The analysis tested the STGCN models and evaluated their prediction performance. Our results indicated that model 1 and model 2 have reliable and accurate performance for predicting road network flooding status in near future (e.g., 2???4 h) with model precision and recall values larger than 98% and 96%, respectively. With reliable road network status predictions in floods, the proposed model can benefit affected communities to avoid flooded roads and the emergency management agencies to implement evacuation and relief resource delivery plans     <comment>Superscript/Subscript Available</comment","<p>Export Date: 16 November 2022</p>

The paper measures the resilience of group road logistics by establishing network structure model. The purpose of this study is to improve the resilience of road log. Design/methodology/approach: This paper adopts Delphi method to collect data, interviews mainly flood management experts and supply chain risk management experts, and then analyzes the data through the network structure model combined with interpretative structure model (ISM) and analytical network process (ANP). Findings: The results show that flood frequency and drainage systems are the main factors affecting the resilience of road transport logistics in urban areas. These research results provide useful guidance for the effective planning and design of urban road construction and infrastructure. Research limitations/implications: However, the main factors affecting the resilience of road transport logistics are likely to change with the development of factors such as climate, economy and environment. Therefore, in future work, the authors' research will focus on the further application of this evaluation method. Practical implications: The results show that the impact of flooding on the four dimensions of road logistics resilience varies. This shows that in deciding what intervention measures are to be taken to improve the resilience of the road network to flooding, various measures need to be considered. Social implications: This paper provides a more scientific analysis of the risk management ability of the road network in the face of floods. In addition, it also provides a useful reference for urban road planners. Originality/value: This paper addresses a clear need to study how to build models to improve the resilience of road logistics in flood risk. © 2022, Emerald Publishing Limited.","<p>Export Date: 16 November 2022</p>

This study was undertaken with an aim to quantitatively measure transportation infrastructure robustness, a proactive dimension of resilience capacities and capabilities to withstand disasters; in this case, floods. A four-stage analytical framework was empirically implemented: 1) specifying the system and disturbance (i.e., road network and flood risks in Chiang Mai, Thailand), 2) illustrating the system response using the damaged area as a function of floodwater levels and protection measures, 3) determining recovery thresholds based on land use and system functionality, and 4) quantifying robustness through the application of edge-and node-betweenness centrality models.

The function loss of URTN not only destroy normal urban life and work order, but also pose a serious threat to people’s lives and properties. Therefore, it is urgent to quantitatively explore the flood resilience of URTN. The concept of resilience puts forward new ideas to help solve the problem of urban flooding disasters from a holistic view. Exploring the flood resilience of urban traffic network may help to mitigate urban flooding and improve the urban resilience. This paper developed a flood resilience evaluation model of URTN, which contains 26 indicators based on the 4R theory. A case study was conducted in southern China to validate the model with real data. It evaluated the urban flood resilience of road traffic network with a comparison of before and after reconstruction of the pipeline. The results demonstrated that the flood resilience of URTN is at a relatively low level in the study area, and the limitation of single traditional engineering measure to the flood resilience of URTN.

We also applied three methods including the divergent ranking method to identify the direct impact of extreme floods on road networks. The shortest travel time pathway calculation was enhanced with the inclusion of spatially distributed settlements as an input. The results indicate a strong relationship between parameter weights and the accessibility measures, irrespective of the evaluated approaches. The results of the study highlight that measures of overall vulnerability, with respect to inter comparisons of flood scenarios alone, do not fully capture the local vulnerability of some traffic zones.

Second, transportation infrastructure is modeled as a network of roads and inundation probabilities are estimated using their distance to the nearest channel together with the vulnerability of the channel. Finally, the post-flooding functionality of the road network is evaluated using graph-based measures. The framework is tested on a combined watershed in Harris County, Texas. Results show that failure of 10% of roads leads to a considerable loss of functionality in the road network. There are clusters of inundated roads in areas where the high density of development is concentrated around channels. The flood inundation also induces secondary impact by isolating the cluster of roads from the giant component.

However, the increase in environmental concerns is pushing host cities to adopt a compact event approach. Compactness increases the concentration of the load on host cities’ infrastructures, which have to preserve an acceptable level of functionality under any possible disturbance; in other words, they should be resilient. Among these infrastructures, the road network plays the most prominent role in the fans’ experiences and the event’s success. To assess its resilience during MSE, we proposed a multilevel assessment approach that focuses on the network cohesion and critical trips performance under several disturbance scenarios, including natural hazards, intentional attacks, and accidents. The framework was applied to the Doha road network, since Doha will be a host city for the FIFA World Cup in Qatar in 2022, which exhibited a high level of resilience to intentional attacks and accidents scenarios. However, during the natural hazard scenario (flooding), the network experienced severe fragmentation, signaling weak resilience and highlighting the need to improve storm management plans. Future research could investigate the use of weighted graphs to increase the accuracy or incorporate different assessment approaches into the framework. © 2021 by the authors.

Transportation infrastructure plays an essential role in flood response and recovery efforts. However, flooding may disturb road functionality and generate direct and indirect adverse impacts, including the loss of access to essential services. This paper presents a comprehensive analysis of flood impacts on road network topology and accessibility to amenities for major communities in the State of Iowa using graph-theoretic methods, including single-source shortest path analyses. We assessed the disruption of transportation networks on the accessibility to critical amenities (e.g., hospitals) under 100 and 500-year flood scenarios. Our analysis methodology leads toward the development of an integrated real-time decision support system that will allow decision makers to explore ""what if"" flood scenarios to identify vulnerable areas and population in their authority. These analyses could promote possible improvements (e.g., temporary relocation of critical services) to mitigate the consequences of road system failure during flooding. Due to varying environmental conditions at specific locations and effects on road topology under flood events, the results show differential impacts in edge and node losses as well as access to critical services. Results indicate that floods can lead to edge losses of up to 18%, and not only large cities but also some small cities can experience significant vulnerability to flooding. Some new or reconstructed bridges have failed to operate during analyzed flood events. During the 100 and 500-year flood return periods, the total number of inaccessible bridges within the selected cities is 184 and 294, respectively. Our work found that the shortest path length to the closest critical amenity under baseline condition can flip to the second or higher-orders during flooding. Many critical amenities have been found at risk of flooding in the studied cities. (c) 2021 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.","<p>Export Date: 16 November 2022</p>

To that end, this study first modeled the road system in a community as a planar graph. Then, the percolation dynamic in the road network during the flood is captured by assigning different removal probabilities to nodes in the road network according to Bayes' rule that take floodplain types, node-elevation, and street-grade as inputs. In the end, an overall road network robustness measure and its temporal changes were obtained and for random and nonrandom scenarios, using road networks with different sizes. The results were compared in order to characterize the vulnerability of road networks under different scenarios. The proposed method was applied to the road network in central Houston during Hurricane Harvey. The results show that: (1) the theoretical network robustness measure is applicable to assess the road network robustness; (2) compared to the random percolation model, the probability (Bayes' rule) based percolation could lead to a greater decrease in the network robustness; and (3) the percolation profiles of the road networks with different sizes are not significantly different.

Recent hazardous events in Greece, for instance, the 2021 Crete earthquake, the 2021 Thessaly earthquakes and floods, and the heavy 2019 rainfall in Crete, have revealed the vulnerability of roadway networks to natural hazards, resulting in severe physical damage and important economic and societal losses. Severe damage on bridges and tunnels of roadway networks is commonly related to the effects of multiple hazards that may act independently during their life span. However, the literature on risk assessment of the above elements commonly focuses on the effects of a single hazard, disregarding the effects of various hazards in a multi-hazard environment. In this context, there is an increasing need for a reasonable and practical evaluation of the multi-hazard risk of transportation infrastructure. Research project INFRARES (https://www.infrares.gr/) aspires to gain further insight into the risk and resilience assessment of bridges and tunnels subjected to independent and/or multiple subsequent natural hazards, proposing a comprehensive framework toward a more efficient risk assessment of the above critical transportation infrastructure components. This paper presents the first part of the framework. More specifically, a unified methodology for the development and graphic presentation of single seismic- and flood-hazard scenarios, as well as of novel multi-seismic-flood hazard scenarios, are presented, providing a valuable tool for risk assessment of roadway networks for separate, combined (triggered), or subsequent hazards. The unified approach followed to develop single seismic and flood hazard scenarios is initially presented. The data required to develop such scenarios are derived from recently published and freely available data accessible via European databases; hence, allowing for a straightforward application of the proposed methodology throughout Europe. The unified approach in developing single hazard scenarios is further exploited to develop integrated seismic-flood hazard scenarios. Single and multi-hazard scenarios are graphically displayed in the form of GIS format maps, with the methodology being applied to the Greek terrain for various hazard scenarios. Recent hazard events that caused significant damage to the Greek road network are also presented to emphasize the importance of proper evaluation of natural hazards and their effects on roadway networks in multi-hazard environments. The methodology developed within this study contributes toward the generation of uniform multi-hazard scenarios for the risk assessment of various structures and networks in a multi-hazard environment. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd","<p>Export Date: 16 November 2022</p>

Ultimate flood impact data, such as flood inundation maps and insurance claims, becomes available only weeks and months after the floods have receded. Crisis response managers, however, need near-real-time data to prioritize emergency response. This time lag creates a need for rapid flood impact assessment. Accordingly, community-scale big data (such as satellite imagery) has been utilized for the early estimation of end flood impacts. Some recent studies have shown promising results for using human activity fluctuations as indicators of flood impacts. Existing studies, however, used mainly a single community-scale activity feature for the estimation of flood impacts and have not investigated their temporal importance for indicating flood impacts. Hence, in this study, we examined the importance of heterogeneous human activity features (such as human mobility, visits to points-of-interest, and social media posts) in different flood event stages. Using four community-scale big data categories we derived ten features related to the variations in human activity (e.g., travel, credit card transactions, and online communications) and evaluated their temporal importance for rapid assessment of flood impacts. Using multiple random forest models, we examined the temporal importance of each feature in indicating the extent of flood impacts (measured by the flood insurance claims and flood inundations) in the context of the 2017 Hurricane Harvey in Harris County, Texas. Our findings reveal that 1) fluctuations in human activity index and percentage of congested roads are the most important indicators for rapid flood impact assessment during response and recovery stages; 2) variations in credit card transactions assumed a middle ranking in both response and recovery stages; and 3) patterns of geolocated social media posts (Twitter) were of low importance across flood stages. Insights derived from data analysis reveal the potential for harnessing community-scale data characterizing human activity fluctuations for rapid assessment of flood impacts. The results of this research could rapidly forge a multi-tool enabling crisis managers to identify hotspots with severe flood impacts at various stages then to plan and prioritize effective response strategies. © 2021 IEEE Access.

Many network-theory based frameworks have been proposed to assess the vulnerability of transportation networks using network centrality based measures; however, those measures can not be directly translated into the actual vulnerability of transportation networks as many studies seem to proclaim. This is because vulnerability is not only about the failure consequence but also failure probability, and there are clear heterogeneities in disaster-exposure levels of the individual nodes due to the spatially embedded nature of transportation networks. It is possible to study and characterize this heterogeneity with the help of classification tools in machine learning. First, the road network at a super neighborhood level is modeled as a primal graph. Then, a new measure for flood exposure of the nodes in a road network was proposed and treated as the dependent variable. Two independent variables, namely elevation and the shortest distance from flood control infrastructure, were identified for each individual node. A classification algorithm was trained and tested in order to predict the flood exposure of individual nodes in the road network. In the end, connectivity of the road network was estimated after removing nodes (which are predicted using the best performing classification algorithm) that are particularly vulnerable to fluvial flooding. The results indicated that the K-means clustering algorithm had the highest prediction accuracy. The proposed methodology was then applied to assess the vulnerability of other super neighborhoods in Houston during Hurricane Harvey. The proposed framework expands the scope of traditional vulnerability assessment analysis for the road networks by effectively making use of machine learning tools, as well as publicly available data.

We used the link flood risk patterns found in the data to train a reinforcement learning model that generates routes that avoid flood-prone areas. We benchmarked the route assistance model with shortest path and most reliable path algorithms, demonstrating our model has balanced path length and path reliability. We provided the flood risk model outputs at the link-level, which city authorities can use to plan road closures ahead of heavy precipitation events.
